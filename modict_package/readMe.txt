//The database folder contains the 3D models generated by the indicated modeling server. 
//Within each protein you will find different mutations and a control. Within these folders
you will find a copy of wildtype and the actual mutated protein. You can open these files in swiss pdb or
any pdb viewer.
//Within each different protein you will also find input folder. These folders contain the extracted RMSD values from a 
pair of mutated superimposed on wildtype.
//For TUBB2B, SMPD1, REN the mutated models have been also sent to Mod-Refiner. This reduces the background noise. 
//However for ACADM and PAH one can use a trendline to estimate back enzymatic activities so no refinement is needed.
//The modict subdirectory is explained in the documentation. You can find documentation at:
"./MODICT/DOCUMENTATION"
